# Result and Performance
## 1. Time analysis  
Our training is more complex, so a key question is: **Does POQD add a lot of overhead?** **The answer is no.** Across multiple QA benchmarks, POQD adds **only slight overhead** compared to the original pipeline.

This **solves Challenge 2** — we get better performance **without major computational cost**.

+ **Training Efficiency**

As shown in **Figure on the left **, the vast majority of training time is spent on fine-tuning the generator. The **prompt optimization component adds only negligible overhead**, confirming that POQD’s training pipeline remains lightweight and scalable.

+ **Inference Efficiency**

**Figure on the right** breaks down inference time into generation, retrieval, and query decomposition. The **decomposition step accounts for a tiny fraction** of total latency — far less than generation or retrieval — making POQD **deployment-friendly even in real-time settings**.

## 2. Performance analysis   
We tested POQD on various QA benchmarks — including single-hop, multi-hop, image QA, and text QA. 

**POQD outperforms the best existing query decomposition methods in both retrieval accuracy and QA performance.**

## 3. A Motivating Example
> Query: *"Victoria Hong Kong has many what type of buildings?"*

| Method                            | Sub-Queries                                 | Result                                             |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| ColBERT                           | ["Victoria", "Hong", "Kong", "buildings"]   | ❌ Matches "Kong" dark regions resembling a gorilla |
| ICL-QD (craft prompts for LLMs  ) | ["Victoria Hong Kong", "buildings", "type"] | ⚠️ Extra token "type" adds noise                    |
| **POQD**                          | **["Victoria Hong Kong", "buildings"]**     | ✅ Correctly retrieves skyscraper images            |

POQD filters out noisy sub-queries and preserves meaningful semantic units.
